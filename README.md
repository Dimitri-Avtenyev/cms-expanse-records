# AP Hogeschool cms assignment

This repository is for an assignment at AP Hogeschool, where we are using [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) as a headless CMS to manage content and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for building a dynamic and engaging website. 
The project combines the power of Strapi for content management and Next.js for seamless frontend development.
